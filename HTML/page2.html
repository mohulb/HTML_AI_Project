    <h3>There are three domains of AI</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
            Data- Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information from countless different sources.<br> In order to use the data we collect to develop practical artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning solutions, <br> it must be collected and stored in a way that makes sense for the business problem at hand.
        </p></li><br>

        <li><p>
            Natural Language Processing- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI)<br>that studies how machines understand human language. Its goal is to build systems that can make sense of <br> text and perform tasks like translation, grammar checking, or topic classification.
        </p></li><br>

        <li><p>
            Computer vison- computer vision is defined as “a subset of mainstream artificial intelligence that deals <br> with the science of making computers or machines visually enabled, i.e., they can analyze and understand an image.<br> ” Human vision starts at the biological camera’s “eyes,” which takes one picture about every 200 milliseconds, <br> while computer vision starts by providing input to the machine.
        </p></li>
