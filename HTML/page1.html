    <p>Artificial intelligence or AI is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines <br> capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an type science with multiple approaches,  <br>  but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a pattern shift in virtually every sector of the <br> tech industry.</p>

<p>The difference between AI and a human is that while Human Intelligence aims to adapt to new environments by utilizing a <br> combination of different cognitive processes, Artificial Intelligence aims to build machines that can mimic human behavior <br> and perform human-like actions. The human brain is analogous, but machines are digital. </p>
